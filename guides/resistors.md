# Resistors

'cmon, you know [what a resistor is](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+is+a+resistor%3F). But here is a quick guide to find out their value.

Good to know, but what's great to know is, this is the table for calculating resistor values!

Colour | Digit | Multiplier
:------|:-----:|:---------:
Black  |   0   | 10^0
Brown  |   1   | 10^1
Red    |   2   | 10^2
Orange |   3   | 10^3
Yellow |   4   | 10^4
Green  |   5   | 10^5
Blue   |   6   | 10^6
Violet |   7   | 10^7
Grey   |   8   | 10^8
White  |   9   | 10^9

Gold is 5% tolerance, and Silver is 10% tolerance.

While reading your resistor, place the Gold or Silver band to the right and read from left to right. So a Blue-Yellow-Orange-Gold would be 64 kÎ© with a tolerance of +/- 5%.

This is great and all, but I know you're lazy and you're not learning this today. So here's the link to a graphical resistance calculator: [Link](http://www.dannyg.com/examples/res2/resistor.htm)
